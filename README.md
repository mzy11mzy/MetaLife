# [MetaLife: Art Interactive Installations](https://www.zhiyima.com/metalife)

# Introduction
What is Life? If a liquid metal droplet can hunt for game, play with companions, and even display personality traits such as shyness, curiosity, brightness and naughtiness, is it alive?
MetaLife is a series of interactive installations, representing different "personalities" of liquid metal "mollusks". When interacting with the audience, the mollusks present personalities and hopefully provide the audience to wonder what life actually is.
